Let's break down **Servlet** and **Dispatcher** in simple terms.

---

### **1. What is a Servlet?**

Think of a **Servlet** as a **waiter in a restaurant**:

* You (the client) place an order (a request).
* The waiter (Servlet) takes your order and brings back your food (response).
* The **Servlet** acts as a middleman between you and the kitchen (server).

In the context of a web application:

* A **Servlet** is a Java program that handles **HTTP requests** and generates **responses**.
* It runs on a server and listens for incoming requests (like a waiter waiting for customers).
* When a request comes in, it processes it and sends back a response (like delivering your order).

**Example:**
When you visit a website and submit a form, a servlet may process your data and respond with a confirmation page.

### **2. What is a Dispatcher?**

Imagine the restaurant has **multiple sections** (like the dining area, bar, and private rooms).

* The **Dispatcher** is like the **head waiter** who decides where to send your order based on what you want.
* If you want a drink, it sends the order to the bar; if you want food, it sends it to the kitchen.

In web applications, a **Dispatcher** (like **Spring's DispatcherServlet**) does the following:

* Acts as a **central controller** for incoming HTTP requests.
* Decides **which specific part** of the application should handle the request (like forwarding to a specific controller or view).
* Manages **routing** and **view rendering**.

//		### **In Short:**
//
//		* **Servlet:** A program that processes requests and sends back responses (like a waiter).
//		* **Dispatcher:** A central controller that routes requests to the correct handler (like a head waiter directing orders).
